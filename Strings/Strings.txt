Strings

Strings are used for storing text/characters.
For example, "Hello There" is a string of characters.
Unlike many other programming languages, C does not have a String type to easily create string variables. Instead, you must use the char type and create an array of characters to make a string in C:

sample:
char a[]="Hello There";

We use the %s as the format specifier for the Strings
sample:
printf("%s",a);

The string index start with 0 and end with the null value at the end
