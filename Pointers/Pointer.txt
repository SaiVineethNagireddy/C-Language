C Pointers

   A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable as its value.
   A pointer variable points to a data type (like int) of the same type, and is created with the * operator.
   The address of the variable you are working with is assigned to the pointer:

   Example:
            #include<stdio.h>
            int main()
            {
                int a=30;
                int* ptr=&a;

                printf("%d \n", a);
                printf("%p \n",&a);//gives the memory address by using &
                printf("%p",ptr);//gives the memory address by using the pointer that we created

                return 0;
            }
