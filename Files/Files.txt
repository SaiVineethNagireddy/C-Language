In C programming, files are used to store data permanently on a disk rather than in RAM (which is temporary and lost after the program ends). The File I/O (Input/Output) in C is handled using the standard library <stdio.h>.

 Why Use Files?
    Persistent Storage: Unlike variables, data in files is not lost when the program ends.
    Data Sharing: Can be used to share data between programs or sessions.
    Handling Large Data: You can store and manage large amounts of data easily.

Types of File Access in C:
    There are two types of file access:
      Text files – Stored as readable characters.
      Binary files – Stored in binary format (more compact and faster to read/write).

In C, you can create, open, read, and write to files by declaring a pointer of type FILE, and use the fopen() function:
syntax:
    FILE *fptr;
fptr = fopen(filename, mode);
