C Structures (structs):
    Structures (also called structs) are a way to group several related variables into one place.
    Each variable in the structure is known as a member of the structure.
    Unlike an array, a structure can contain many different data types (int, float, char, etc.).

Create a Structure:
    You can create a structure by using the struct keyword and declare each of its members inside curly braces:
Syntax:
    struct MyStructure 
    {                        // Structure declaration
        int myNum;           // Member (int variable)
        char myLetter;       // Member (char variable)
    };                       // End the structure with a semicolon


C Unions:
    A union is similar to a struct in that it can store members of different data types.
However, there are some differences:
In a struct, each member has its own memory.
In a union, all members share the same memory, which means you can only use one of the values at a time.
