Operators
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:

Example:
      #include <stdio.h>
      int main() 
    {
      int myNum = 100 + 50;
      printf("%d", myNum);
      return 0;
    }

 C divides the operators into the following groups:

1. Arithmetic operators
2. Assignment operators
3. Comparison operators
4. Logical operators
5. Bitwise operators
